Remember: Don't delete Feature before refreshing


To Do
==========
Protein translation
Gene /note - need to cope with multiple /note too
Gene /curation
new style /GO loading
Partial genes
Pseudogenes
Controlled curation
Get schisto data
EMBL output - strict and PSU
GFF3 output
GO association output
cosmid artificial feature storage
New naming proposal
PMID lookup needed proposal
Gene /product as controlled curation
Store RILEY
Chase GMOD group re exon sharing or not
Write BacterialNomenclatureHandler (cp2)

New ORM
=========
Read JPA spec
Change feature so length, checksum set when sequence set (done, but need to change field access type to avoid setter?)
Class/method name tidying (done)
Generate interfaces
Work out containing entities
Feature residues to byte[]
HiLo sequence generator - feature, featureprop (done so far)
Something about setting timestamps automatically
Change cvterm field name to type - Feature, featureprop (done so far)
Change boolean fields to lose is (done) 
Remove public schema from mapping files (done)
Try detailed lifecycle handling of feature and feature prop (need testing)
Print mapping files for checklists
ant build file for Hibernate - only delete particular .java etc
Keep comparing generated schema with original

Done
==========
Create ORM layer for GeneDB
Create basic loader infrastructure
Load one top level source feature
Load CDSs according to chado guidelines
Create gene naming abstraction, and GeneDB-specific version
Basic config code
Protein name
Protein stats
Gene /colour - temp for Tim
Synthetic feature construction
Change exon naming as can be shared
gene /product as a controlled vocab, and multiple products
Remove all persist from indivual DAOs
Contig offset storage
Splicing
Alternative transcripts
Split config and it's parser into seperate parts
