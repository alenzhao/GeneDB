  <i>
   Plasmodium vivax
  </i>
  , the second most important causal agent of human malaria, is the most geographically distributed of the malaria parasites outside Africa (&gt;50% of malaria cases in Asia and in Central and South America), infecting between 130-435 million people every year.
  <i>
   P. vivax
  </i>
  is responsible for the development of a clinically less severe disease than that caused by
  <i>
   P. falciparum
  </i>
  , and rarely does
  <i>
   P.vivax
  </i>
  malaria progress to the life-threatening manifestations observed with
  <i>
   P.falciparum
  </i>
  infections.
