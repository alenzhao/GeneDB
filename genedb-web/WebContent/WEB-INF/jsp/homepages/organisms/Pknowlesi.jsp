  <i>
   P. knowlesi
  </i>
  is predominantly a simian-infection malaria parasite, but also causes natural infection in humans, primarily in South East Asia.
  <i>
   P. knowlesi
  </i>
  was the first malaria parasite in which antigen variation was demonstrated. It has close phylogenetic relationship to
  <i>
   P. vivax
  </i>
  , the second most important species of human malaria parasite.

 <p>
  We have generated a whole genome shotgun, to 8x coverage of
  <i>
   P. knowlesi
  </i>
  (H strain, Pk1(A+)clone). The H strain originally came from a naturally infected patient and was acquired in peninsular Malaysia in 1965. Genomic DNA was provided by Clemens Kocken (BPRC).
