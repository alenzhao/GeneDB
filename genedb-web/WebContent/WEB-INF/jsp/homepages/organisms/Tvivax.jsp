<p><b>The disease</b></p>
<p><i>Trypanosoma vivax</i> is a major livestock pathogen in Africa and some South American countries. Despite the severe disease it causes, <i>T. vivax</i> remains largely unstudied.</p>
<p><b>The genome</b></p>
<p>The Sanger Institute's Pathogen Genomics group, in collaboration with Professor David Barry (Glasgow University, UK), Dr Alberto Davila (Instituto Oswalso Cruz, Brazil) and Dr Phelix Majiwa (International Livestock Institute, Kenya), has carried out a partial genome shotgun of this parasite. The current coverage is 5x.</p>
<p><b>The Database</b></p>
<p>GeneDB has been funded by Wellcome Trust to provide full curation support for kinetoplastida genomes to meet the needs of the community.<b> </b>New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the Trypanosomatid research community. In collaboration with GeneDB, the EuPathDB genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on <a href="http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/"><b>TriTrypDB</b></a> where they can be integrated with other datasets and queried using customized queries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Downloads</b></p>
<p>As soon as they are produced, the most up to date <i>T. vivax</i> annotations are always available at GeneDB.However, we recommend TriTrypDB as the portal for sequence download, where the date are periodically released with version numbers for consistent cross-referencing in publications.</p>
<p><b>Data Release</b></p>
<p>This sequencing centre plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale. For further information see our data release policy (linkout).</p>
