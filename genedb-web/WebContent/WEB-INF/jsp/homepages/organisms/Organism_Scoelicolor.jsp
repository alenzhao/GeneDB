    Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

  is the model representative of a group of soil-dwelling organism with a complex lifecycle involving mycelial growth and spore formation. These microbes are notable for their production of pharmaceutically useful compound including anti-tumour agents, immunosupressants and over two-thirds of all natural antibiotics currently available. The sequence was generated using a clone-by-clone approach, initially using cosmids generated and mapped by David Hopwood's group at the John Innes Centre, and latterly using a BAC library to fill gaps and confirm the map.
