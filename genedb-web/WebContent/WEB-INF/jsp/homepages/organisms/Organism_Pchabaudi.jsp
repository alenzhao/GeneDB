 <p>
  As part of a large scale survey of the
  <i>
   Plasmodium
  </i>
  lifecyle an initial survey of the
  <i>
   P. chabaudi
  </i>
  genome has been published based on analysis of a ~3x partial genome shotgun.
Whole genome shotgun sequencing has continued to 8x coverage. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences of
  <i>
   P. chabaudi
  </i>
  AS in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale.
