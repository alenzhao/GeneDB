   The Disease
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing Unit (PSU) is partially shotgun sequencing the nuclear genome of the human-infective
  <i>
   Trypanosoma brucei gambiense
  </i>
  . While the non-human-infective
  <i>
   T. b. brucei
  </i>
  is the preferred model organism for studying trypanosome biology, comparison with a human-infective organism is required to study mechanisms of disease. Human trypanosomiasis is caused by 2 other subspecies of
  <i>
   T. brucei
  </i>
  -
  <i>
   T. b. rhodesiense
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   T. b. gambiense
  </i>
  .
  <i>
   T. b. rhodesiense
  </i>
  is very similar to
  <i>
   T. b. brucei
  </i>
  , and so the genome sequence of
  <i>
   T. b. brucei
  </i>
  will provide information on both subspecies. However,
  <i>
   T. b. gambiense
  </i>
  stands apart, with profoundly different biological and genetic characteristisc (click

  to see more details). The
  <i>
   T. b. gambiense
  </i>
  genome will serve as a useful comparative genomics resource to complement the genomes of
  <i>
   Trypanosoma vivax
  </i>
  ,
  <i>
   Trypanosoma congolense
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   Trypanosoma brucei
  </i>
  , which has been sequenced in collaboration between the PSU and The Institute for Genomic Research. The
  <i>
   T. b. gambiense
  </i>
  partial shotgun project is being carried out in collaboration with Wendy Gibson (University of Bristol, UK).

   The Database
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  GeneDB has been funded by Wellcome Trust to provide full curation support for kinetoplastida genomes to meet the needs of the community.
  <b>
  </b>
  New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the Trypanosomatid research community. In collaboration with GeneDB, the EuPathDB genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on

  where they can be integrated with other datasets and queried using customized queries.

 <p>
  As soon as they are produced, the most up to date
  <i>
   T. brucei gambiense
  </i>
  annotations are always available at GeneDB. However, we recommend TriTrypDB as the portal for sequence download, where the date are periodically released with version numbers for consistent cross-referencing in publications.

   Data Release
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  This sequencing centre plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale. For further information see our data release policy(linkout).
