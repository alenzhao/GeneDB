It is maintained by the Pathogen Informatics Group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK. You can connect to a suitable chado-based database by specifying the connection details at the start. </p><table border="4" bordercolor="#0000A0"><tr><td><a href="jar/Jogra.jnlp"> Launch Jogra </a></td></tr></table><br /><hr /><h2>Organism Chooser</h2><p align="justify">The Organism Chooser application allows the user to select the organism(s) that he or she wants to work with. This sets the scopefor all the tools contained within Jogra. </p><h2>Term Rationaliser</h2><p align="justify">The Term Rationaliser is a controlled vocabulary curation tool. It allows the user to select a vocabulary (e.g., Gene Products) and correct any redundant or erroneous names. For instance, slightly different spellings for the same term can all be rationalised into the correct name easily, withouthaving to go through the database. Additionally, you can restrict the scope of your changes by selecting the organisms you want to make the changes in.</p><p>More information on how to launch and use the Term Rationaliser can be found <a href="Jogra-help.html">here</a>.</p><image src="images/screen-shot.png" height="400" width="400" alt="Screen shot of the Rationaliser"><hr /><p>30th November 2009</p><p><b><i>Please send any queries, comments and suggestions to nds@sanger.ac.uk </i></b></p></body></html>
